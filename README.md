# PHISHING-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
This is my first project. 
Here, we have verified 4 algorithms  namely AdaBoost Classifier, Logistic Regression, Regular Boosting Classifier and Decision tree using a CSV file which has 11055 data entries and 31 features. After verifying 4 algorithms, Decision tree makes more accuracy. Using the 31 features, a feature extraction module was created to detect the uniqueness of the URL and it will be imported in the source code and we are using numpy, pandas and sklearn libraries to detect the legitimacy of the url. Here I attach with the works by my team and the source code of that and the feature extraction file.
