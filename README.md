# PHISHING-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
This is my first project. 
Here, we have verified 4 algorithms using a CSV file which has 11055 data entries and 31 features. After verifying AdaBoost Classifier, Logistic Regression, Regular Boosting Classifier and Decision tree, Decision tree makes more accuracy and a feature extraction module was created to detect the technique and we are using numpy, pandas and sklearn libraries to detect the legitimacy of the url. Here I attach with the works by my team and the source code of that.
